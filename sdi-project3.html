    <h1>SDI 1209: Daniel Campo</h1>
    <h2>Project 2</h2>
</header>
<article>
<p>The theme I chose is based off a game I've recently began playing. The game is called Dust 514 and is part of the Eve Online PC game universe. This particular game is exclusive to the Playstation 3 and is completely free to play.</p>
<p>The game is essentially about orbital combat where you are a mercenary hired by the companies in the PC game to wage war against other company's mercenaries in order to conquer a planet. Once conquered, that company is able to harvest the resources of that planet.</p>
